# Team-18

## Our project focused on developing an effecient data-analysis tool for the non-profit organization Netcare Access. The tool seeks to provide three main solutions: effecient data filtering, data sharing, and predictive capabilities. 

## To run the react-app: npm start in client folder

## To run the express-server: npm start in server folder

## To set-up local SQLite: node ./table.js in server folder
